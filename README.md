Forked from [NG6-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/NG6-starter), based on Angular 1.x & Webpack 1.x, a great code base to start playing with Angular Webpack and ES6 together !

#TODO LIST

NG6-starter does already a great job, but this starter will have few improvements to feet my own needs.

- [] Linting : ESLINT (ES6 + Airbnb + Angularjs - [Johnpapa style](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1) cf. http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/linting_in_webpack/
- [] Code coverage
- [] Phantomjs by default (instead of Chrome) for Unit Tests
- [] JSDoc
- [] Style guide (css doc)

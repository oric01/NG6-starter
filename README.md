#Source

Forked from [NG6-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/NG6-starter), based on Angular 1.x & Webpack 1.x

#TODOS

NG6-starter does already a great job. But this starter will have few differences with the original NG6-starter to feet my own needs.

##High

- [] Code coverage
- [] Phantomjs by default (instead of Chrome)
- [] SASS instead of Stylus (not a space based template fan...)
- [] Build server (to test dist result)
- [] REST API generator (for data mock)

##Medium

- [] Material design component generator
- [] Style customisation editor

##Low

- Webpack bundle stats
